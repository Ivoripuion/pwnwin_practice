    ACTIVEX CONTROL DLL : VulnerAX_SEH Project Overview
========================================================================

ControlWizard has created this project for your VulnerAX_SEH ActiveX Control
DLL, which contains 1 control.

This skeleton project not only demonstrates the basics of writing an
ActiveX Control, but is also a starting point for writing the specific
features of your control.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files
that make up your VulnerAX_SEH ActiveX Control DLL.

VulnerAX_SEH.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an
    Application Wizard. It contains information about the version of
    Visual C++ that generated the file, and information about the platforms,
    configurations, and project features selected with the Application Wizard.

VulnerAX_SEH.h
    This is the main include file for the ActiveX Control DLL.  It
    includes other project-specific includes such as resource.h.

VulnerAX_SEH.cpp
    This is the main source file that contains code for DLL initialization,
    termination and other bookkeeping.

VulnerAX_SEH.rc
    This is a listing of the Microsoft Windows resources that the project
    uses.  This file can be directly edited with the Visual C++ resource
    editor.

VulnerAX_SEH.def
    This file contains information about the ActiveX Control DLL that
    must be provided to run with Microsoft Windows.

VulnerAX_SEH.idl
    This file contains the Object Description Language source code for the
    type library of your control.

VulnerAX_SEH.ico
    This file contains an icon that will appear in the About box.  This icon
    is included by the main resource file VulnerAX_SEH.rc.

CVulnerAX_SEHCtrl control:

VulnerAX_SEHCtrl.h
    This file contains the declaration of the CVulnerAX_SEHCtrl C++ class.

VulnerAX_SEHCtrl.cpp
    This file contains the implementation of the CVulnerAX_SEHCtrl C++ class.

VulnerAX_SEHPropPage.h
    This file contains the declaration of the CVulnerAX_SEHPropPage C++ class.

VulnerAX_SEHPropPage.cpp
    This file contains the implementation of the CVulnerAX_SEHPropPage C++ class.

CVulnerAX_SEHCtrl.bmp
    This file contains a bitmap that a container will use to represent the
    CVulnerAX_SEHCtrl control when it appears on a tool palette.  This bitmap
    is included by the main resource file VulnerAX_SEH.rc.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

stdafx.h, stdafx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named VulnerAX_SEH.pch and a precompiled types (PCT) file named stdafx.obj.

resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    The Visual C++ resource editor reads and updates this file.
